A quick-draw/guessing game app

Build a ‘Draw & Guess’ game for 2 players. 

The game includes 5 views: 
Welcome view 
Word choosing view 
Drawing view 
Guessing view (reuse of drawing view with an input for entering the word) 
Waiting view 

The first player starts the game by choosing between 10 given words (easy, medium, hard), then they will try to draw the word’s meaning. 
While drawing, the second player will see the drawing and will try to guess the word. Once succeeded, they will get to pick a new word, draw it, and so on. 
Rules: The first player who starts the game will have to wait for the second player to join (refresh at both tabs for starting a new game). Players can guess as many times they want. 
When guessing right, the game session will earn points: 
Easy word - 1 point, Medium word - 3 points, Hard word - 5 points
