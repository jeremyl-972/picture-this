#### Description:
A web based quick-draw/guessing game app for 2 players.

The first player starts the game by choosing between 10 given words (easy, medium, hard), then they will try to draw the wordâ€™s meaning. 
While drawing, the second player will see the drawing and will try to guess the word. Once succeeded, they will get to pick a new word, draw it, and so on. 
Rules: The first player who starts the game will have to wait for the second player to join (refresh at both tabs for starting a new game). Players can guess as many times they want. 
When guessing right, the game session will earn points: 
Easy word - 1 point, Medium word - 3 points, Hard word - 5 points
